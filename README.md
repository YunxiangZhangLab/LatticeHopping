MC simulation of energy migration over β-NaYbF4 P6bar lattice via Dexter's exchange mechanism
The hexagonal-phase(β) NaREF4 upconversion nanocrystals (RE = rare earth elements) are an important family of luminescent nanomaterials due to its unique optical properties. This piece of code simulates the energy migration over the Ytterbium sublattice network via Dexter's exchange mechanism.
